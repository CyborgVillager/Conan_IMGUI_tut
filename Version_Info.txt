yea, this will be more basic, most likely plug & play, not refine, etc.

For AstroRoost will be bit more refined and better documentation for the purpose of the mini, 2nd project and the main.

Prob for now will combine IMGUI with the mini, then later make a sep public respo on Astro for plug in play , containing only IMGUI . Using the local tuts on local drive to build a
sketch up for the mini project purpose atm.
